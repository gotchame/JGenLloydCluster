# Java Implementation for Generalized Lloyd / Linde-Buzo-Gray Algorithm

This small Java library implements the [Generalized-Lloyd or Linde-Buzo-Gray Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linde%96Buzo%96Gray_algorithm) for vector quantization. It therefore allows clustering of vectors of any dimension. This is helpful for example for image classification when using the SIFT or SURF algorithms. It might be also useful if you want to cluster a large amount of points on a map.
